# NZ-ALPR (Automatic license plate recognition)
**This is still under development - ALPR accuracy will be limited.**

OpenALPR-Trained with 800+ of my own images for NZ region. (Images were taken from a PTZ using a script to save and delete after training.)

For existing openalpr installations:
Copy the contents of the "openalpr" folder found in "openalpr_nz_runtime_folder -> openalpr.." into your existing installation runtime directory.
